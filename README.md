# cloudflare_ip_grabber

I've been mad recently that i couldn't do tiny project of mine because of cloudflare.
Then i've found aboud response.text and its uses.

Since our IPS in cloudflare are "hidden" by tiny spoiler that by single accidental mouse move can be seen
you might just as well make this Python script.
